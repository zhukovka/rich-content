## Motivation

In opposite to the original [draft-js-plugins](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins) principle of complete plugin separation and independency, `Ricos` provides a solid yet flexible foundation that helps to extend the editor functionality. On other hand, it means that a plugin should be developed in a certain way.

## Source Code

Basically, there is no limitation on plugin source code hosting. At the moment, all the plugins are hosted in this repo, under the /packages dir.

## Contribution Policy

TBD
