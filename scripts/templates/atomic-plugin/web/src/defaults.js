  This module contains default params for your plugin.
  You can add whatever you like here.

  THEME - receives 'colors' object (palette) and returns a css object which is the exact css style of the plugin,
          but with a transformation of colors based on the palette.
          Please find examples of usage in other plugins.
  DEFAULTS - should contain at least an empty 'config' (or else the wrapper won't work)
